QUESTION 2 - ESSAY QUESTION - 40 POINTS 
FACTS: Assume Sponge Bob drills a well on Ole McDonald’s Farm after modifying his drilling plans as you suggested so he could obtain the required permits and legal permissions required. The well Sponge Bob drills in fact produces crude oil, but has surprised Sponge Bob in that the well is also producing 25 barrels of salt water for every barrel of oil produced. Sponge Bob is thinking about disposing of the salt water by injecting it underground in a disposal well drilled on the McDonald Farm, but is also considering dumping the salt water into a local stream. 

The new well also produces natural gas, but instead of flaring the natural gas as he originally proposed Sponge 
Bob suggests storing the gas underground on the McDonald Farm property. A geologist has told Sponge Bob a 
suitable formation exists under the McDonald Farm that could safely hold the injected natural gas without the 
gas migrating away. Sponge Bob is somewhat concerned that if he re-injects the natural gas he would lose 
ownership of it, but is unsure on this point. Sponge Bob also thinks he will need a loan to finance the gas 
storage project. 
 
Question 2: Discuss Sponge Bob’s proposal for the salt water and natural gas and advise him how to proceed, 
including a discussion of the following issues: 
 
(1) who does Sponge Bob need approval from to inject the salt water in an injection well on the McDonald 
 Farm? 
(2) can he dump the salt water into the stream? 
(3) who does he need permission from to inject the natural gas? 
(4) does he lose ownership of the natural gas once it is re-injected? 
(5) if Sponge Bob needs a loan what assets can he use as collateral and how will they be secured by the lender? 
(6) any other issues with these additional facts that you can think of we talked about in class dealing with 
 Sponge Bob’s project.
