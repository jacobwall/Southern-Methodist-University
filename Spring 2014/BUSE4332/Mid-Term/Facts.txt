QUESTION 1 - ESSAY QUESTION - 45 POINTS 
After watching a documentary on TV addressing technological developments in the energy sector, Sponge Bob decides he wants to drill an oil or gas well in Texas. He knows nothing about oil or gas development or law so has hired you to advise him as to the details. 
 
FACTS: Sponge Bob decides he wants to drill a new well near an existing oil or gas field on a 640 acre farm owned by Ole McDonald. Wells #1 through #10 have been drilled in the offsetting sections to the location where Sponge Bob plans to drill, and these offset wells produce mainly natural gas but also some crude oil from the Barnett Shale formation. 
 
The McDonald Farm is quite active, with extensive livestock operations on site. When approached, Ole McDonald was not interested in any drilling operations on his lands - in fact he was quite upset that Sponge Bob was even considering drilling on his farm. Ole told Sponge Bob he did not own any of the underlying mineral rights, therefore could not grant Sponge Bob the right to drill anyway. 
 
Sponge Bob proposes locating the McDonald Farm well as close to existing production as possible, so he proposes drilling five feet from the property line (see plat). Sponge Bob thinks the new well will probably produce mostly crude oil. He proposes to produce the oil and store it in a large tank on the McDonald Farm and suggests he will ‘flare’ the natural gas discovered, if any, in a manner that will light up the entire farm area so the cattle can see at night. 
 
Once a week a semitrailer will come into the McDonald Farm and empty the oil tank, taking the product to a refiner who will pay Sponge Bob for the oil.
