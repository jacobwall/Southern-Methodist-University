Question 1:

	There are a few areas to address first. TRC Rule 37 requires that wells not be drilled nearer than 467 feet to any property line as well as no wells can be drilled nearer than 1,200 feet apart. This immediately impacts Sponge Bob and his desire to be as close to Ole McDonalds' land as possible. Sponge Bob will need to work with the owner of the mineral rights at the adjacent property to obtain permission. He can receive this information by contacting the County Clerk's office.
